                <h1>About Me</h1>
                 <p>My name is McKenzie Kane, and I am currently a sophmore at Washington and Lee University looking to study strategic communication. For the past three years I have been a participant spokesperson for the First Tee of Tampa Bay, describing my personal experiences with donors of the organization as well as communicating the opinions of my fellow participants.  I am grateful for inheriting the ability to associate myself with others and build meaningful connections </p>

        <h1>Where I Come From</h1>
        <p>I was born and raised in Berlin, CT until 2016 when my family moved down to Tampa, FL. I graduated class of 2021 from Steinbrenner High School and played varsity golf all four years. My mother is a physical therapist, athletic trainer, exercise physiologist who graduated from the University of. Bridgeport and Adelphi University. She was a college gymnast for four years and pursued her work in physically therapy among professional and olympic athletes. My father graduated with a degree in political science from Amherst College where he played variety baseball all four years. My brother recently graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2020 where he spent three years as a varsity cheerleader. I suppose you could say the athleticism gene runs in the family because I am proud to say I am apart of the Washington and Lee Women's Varsity Golf team.</p>
