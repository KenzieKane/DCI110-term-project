                    About Me
                  </strong>
                </h5>
                 <p>My name is McKenzie Kane, and I am currently a Sophomore at Washington and Lee University looking to study strategic communications with a minor in data science-business analytics. I am also a member of the university’s conference championship Women’s golf team. For the past four years I have been a participant spokesperson for the First Tee of Tampa Bay, describing my personal experiences with executive donors of the organization. It was during my time with the organization that I developed an interest in public speaking and communications within sports. I was so inspired that this Fall, I contacted the producer of our county’s student-run broadcast news show. I pitched him my idea of incorporating an on-field post-game interviewer for our University’s Fall sports teams. Impressed by my initiative, I was granted the opportunity to film, edit, and produce a 90 second package for each weekly broadcasts. After college, I’d love to combine my passions for sports and strategic communications into my career. 
                  I am grateful for my education and this opportunity to further develop my ability to build meaningful connections with others using effective communication skills.

            Where I Come From
          </strong>
        </h5>
        <p>I was born and raised in Berlin, CT until 2016 when my family moved down to Tampa, FL. I graduated class of 2021 from Steinbrenner High School and played varsity golf all four years. My mother is a physical therapist, athletic trainer, exercise physiologist who graduated from the University of. Bridgeport and Adelphi University. She was a college gymnast for four years and pursued her work in physically therapy among professional and olympic athletes. My father graduated with a degree in political science from Amherst College where he played variety baseball all four years. My brother recently graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2020 where he spent three years as a varsity cheerleader. I suppose you could say the athleticism gene runs in the family because I am proud to say I am apart of the Washington and Lee Women's Varsity Golf team.</p>
